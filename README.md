Welcome to the digital echo chamber of a student full-stack engineer with a penchant for problem-solving, syntax sorcery, and humor that borders on sentient. I’m currently rewriting my GitHub story—armed with GitHub Pro and a chaotic drive to build, break, and rebuild.

## ⚡ About Me
- 🧩 Full-stack student engineer & systems admin-in-training  
- 🧠 Obsessed with general knowledge, elegant syntax, and solving problems that shouldn’t exist  
- 🤡 Humor is my debugging tool  
- 🧪 Experimental by nature, hacker-core by aesthetic
---

## 🛠️ Tech Arsenal
- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, C, Bash, and occasionally fluent in Stack Overflow  
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Express, Django (when I’m feeling brave)  
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, Docker, Linux, VS Code, caffeine-fueled commits  
- **Special Powers:** Turning obscure error messages into working solutions (eventually)

---

## 📚 Currently Learning
- Advanced backend systems and scaling strategies  
- The art of writing *actual* documentation (instead of TODOs)  
- Rust (because every developer must suffer at some point)  
- How to touch grass 🌱 (work in progress)  

---

## 🚀 Projects
- 🌀 **Infinite Sandbox:** A chaotic playground of random experiments, snippets, and half-baked brilliance  
- 🔒 **SecuriTeach:** Tools and notes from my adventures in ethical hacking and system hardening  
- 🌐 **Portfolio 2.0:** Where I try to convince the internet that I’m employable  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Write cleaner code than yesterday  
- Automate my bad habits away  
- Contribute to open-source projects that matter  
- Survive without pushing to `main` at 3AM  

---

## 🎭 Fun Facts
- I commit in bursts of manic inspiration rather than scheduled productivity  
- Linux terminal > fancy GUI (fight me)  
- My code either runs flawlessly or explodes spectacularly—there is no in-between  
- Favorite debugging method: rubber duck… or sarcasm
